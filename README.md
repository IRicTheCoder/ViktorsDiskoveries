<b>This mod is an expansion pack for Slime Rancher, it adds a new storyline focused on the result of Viktor's Slimeulation. Bringing new content, features, gadgets, upgrades, and possibly even new areas to the game. This storyline is built with the idea that the player can still update the game and have a side storyline without any issues.</b>
