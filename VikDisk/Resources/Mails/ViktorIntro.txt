I hope this email finds you well, Beatrix. I have amazing news, with my Slimulation I was able to figure out something explendid about slimes!

It seems that the slimes we have encountered so far are infected with a virus that messes up some of their functions. I have deployed a vacine that should improve slime behaviour.

Be aware that with this vacine some unexpected behaviours might arise, this is a list of what I found so far, but who knows about the secrets the slimes still hide from us. So many possiblities... Oh yeah, the list, here it is:
- Pink slimes can finally enjoy their favorite foods. Carrots, Pogofruits and Hen Hens
- Saber slimes (or their decendants at least) have revealed that Elder Hens and Elder Roostros are something they enjoy
- Kookadobas will make slimes generate strange results
- Every slime loves to eat Gilded Ginger, and they even produce more plorts!

I also sent you an upgrade to your gardens so now you can produce Kookadobas and Gilged Ginger on them!

Best of Luck,
Viktor Humphries

PS: Did you know that kookadobas grew all over the Far, Far Range? But before this virus the slimes ate all of them. They survived in the Wilds, merely because the feral state of the saber decendants makes them hunt for the massive population of hens in the area, leaving the kookadobas alone!
