	- Pink and Sabes Slimes now have a favorite food
	- New lore was added to the game. Using mails, new slime pedia entries, etc.
	- Kookadobas are now a secret food that makes slimes produce weird stuff (Slime Resources)
	- Gilded Gingers will make slimes drop 3 plorts instead of one
	- Slime Resources can now be vaccumed by Plort Collectors (that got renamed to Adv. Collectors)
	- New Vaccable stuff have been added (Saber Slimes, Toys, etc.)
	- New Slime combinations are possible, among them, pure largos and rainbow slime
	- Pure saber slimes can be aquired in a complicated way
	- Tarrs are now ranchable (In adventure mode they can only be obtained by feeding a Manifold Cube to a Lucky Slime)
	- And others
	
	Note that all features can be disabled through the config file found inside the mod folder, all progress is saved, by save file, inside the same folder.
	Just delete the file to reset your progress on a given save.
	
	Some of this things are only possible after you unlock something, mostly relevant to the lore and new upgrades.
	
	Extra Thanks and Credits:
