pedia:m.intro.pink_slime: "Their coral hue is scientifically proven to be the color of cheer."
pedia:m.diet.pink_slime: "Fruit, Veggies, Meat"
pedia:m.favorite.pink_slime: "(none)"
pedia:m.slimeology.pink_slime: "Pink Slimes are the most common slime found on the Far, Far Range. Theyâ€™re cheerful, docile, and the easiest of all slimes to ranch. A pink slime will eat anything you put in front of it, though they have no favorite food, and their plorts are the least valuable of all slimes."
pedia:m.risks.pink_slime: "Not much to worry about with a pink slime. They're soft, squishy, very happy to be around a rancher, and found all over the Range. But because of this, a rancher won't go far without finding a few pink plorts, which can lead to largos, and then..."
pedia:m.plortonomics.pink_slime: "Pink Plorts are an excellent 'multipurpose generic substance' used to manufacture everything from food products to household cleaners. All over earth, people are eating burgers, sweetening their coffees or scrubbing their floors with pink plort products. That's some serious versatility!"

pedia:m.diet.rock_slime: "Veggies"
pedia:m.favorite.rock_slime: "Heart Beet"
pedia:m.slimeology.rock_slime: "Rock slimes earned their name from the rocky crown of sharp spikes atop their slimy bodies. But their affection for minerals doesn't end with their appearance: rock slimes are strict vegetarians, favoring the satisfying crunch of the heart beet most of all."
pedia:m.risks.rock_slime: "The dangers of a rock slime should be fairly obvious: their rocky crown is sharp enough to pierce straight through a rancher's boots. But it's not all about watching where you're stepping as these rocks are always rolling. When you see a rock slime revving up for a tumble, it's best to get out of the way."
pedia:m.plortonomics.rock_slime: "Rock plorts are prized for being a key component in the production of 'blue metal,' an amazing alloy that's stronger than titanium and lighter than plastic. Because of its amazing strength, blue metal is often a key component in the hulls of light-speed capable starships, synthetic appendages, and protective holophone cases."
pedia:t.tabby_slime: "Tabby Slime"
pedia:m.intro.tabby_slime: "Those stripes, that tail, that wiggle, wiggle, wiggle."
pedia:m.diet.tabby_slime: "Meat"
pedia:m.favorite.tabby_slime: "Stony Hen"
pedia:m.slimeology.tabby_slime: "Tabby slimes share many curious similarities to domesticated house cats of Earth. With their perky ears, striped backs, and swaying tails, you'd almost mistake them for a true feline... if they weren't made entirely of gooey slime, of course."
pedia:m.risks.tabby_slime: "A tabby slime generally doesn't mean any harm to a rancher, but like their spiritual Earth cat cousins, often causes a great deal of chaos anyway. Tabby slimes love to steal things they don't eat, like fruits and veggies, resulting in lots of unintended largo transformations on the Range."
pedia:m.plortonomics.tabby_slime: "Tabby plorts are a key ingredient in a variety of 'performance enhancing' products that grant the consumer a surge of the tabby slime's signature energy and exuberance. And while athletes the world over take them to gain an edge, prolonged use often results in 'uncontrollable butt wiggles,' another (less desirable) signature of the tabby slime."
pedia:t.phosphor_slime: "Phosphor Slime"

pedia:m.diet.phosphor_slime: "Fruit"
pedia:m.favorite.phosphor_slime: "Cuberry"
pedia:m.slimeology.phosphor_slime: "Phosphor slimes come out at night, flying about the moonlit range upon their translucent wings. Phosphor slimes have a luminescent slime core that pulses with a soft glow, making them easy to spot. It's for this reason ranchers sometimes refer to them as 'low stars.'"
pedia:m.risks.phosphor_slime: "Phosphor slimes have special needs compared to your typical slime. A phosphor slime and its plorts will quickly vanish if exposed to sunlight, meaning a rancher could quickly lose an entire corral's worth of phosphor slimes if they're not careful. Ranchers must either vac them up before daybreak or keep phosphor slimes in a place that is perpetually dark, like a cave."
pedia:m.plortonomics.phosphor_slime: "The luminescent compound found within phosphor plorts can produce light for over 100 years, making it an incredibly eco-friendly form of illumination on Earth. Cities across the globe are slowly switching over to phosphor lights, saving trillions of gigawatts of energy daily. Plus if you rub the stuff in your hair, it glows and looks really cool."
pedia:t.rad_slime: "Rad Slime"
pedia:m.intro.rad_slime: "Its radiance is so lovely it makes you sick."
pedia:m.diet.rad_slime: "Veggies"
pedia:m.favorite.rad_slime: "Oca Oca"
pedia:m.slimeology.rad_slime: "It's unknown if rad slimes, sometimes called 'raddies,' came to be from external radiation sources or from something naturally ocurring within the Far, Far Range. Regardless, rad slimes emit such a potent aura of radiation they glow in the dark!"
pedia:m.risks.rad_slime: "A rad slime's radioactive aura can induce rad poisoning in a rancher if they remain within it for too long. Ranchers are advised to monitor their rad exposure levels when handling these green globs of gamma goo as extended exposure can cause serious bodily harm, or worse."
pedia:m.plortonomics.rad_slime: "Given that raddies are basically mobile batteries, itâ€™s no surprise that corporations value rad plorts for their incredible energy-producing capabilities. Most rad plorts get turned into â€˜plortoniumâ€™ and everything from the latest holophone to a radwave microcook system runs on the stuff."
pedia:t.boom_slime: "Boom Slime"

pedia:m.diet.boom_slime: "Meat"
pedia:m.favorite.boom_slime: "Briar Hen"
pedia:m.slimeology.boom_slime: "Boom slimes are often heard before they're seen. The slime cells of a boom slime are constantly vibrating, causing their slime to increasingly crackle with energy before ultimately exploding. However, the boom slime always comes out unscathed, though always a little dazed."
pedia:m.risks.boom_slime: "Boom slimes are constantly building toward an inevitable explosion, making them quite hazardous to ranchers. In addition to those explosions causing bodily harm, they also have the capacity to send all nearby slimes flying into the air, making them a hard slime to corral."
pedia:m.plortonomics.boom_slime: "Highly volatile boom plorts have all sorts of applications, including powering rocket thrusters and demolitions. Military organizations value their highly destructive capabilities for â€˜medical technology and other research.â€™ Imagine that!"
pedia:t.honey_slime: "Honey Slime"
pedia:m.intro.honey_slime: "Nothing is sweeter than (a recently produced plort of) honey."
pedia:m.diet.honey_slime: "Fruit"
pedia:m.favorite.honey_slime: "Mint Mango"
pedia:m.slimeology.honey_slime: "Honey slimes are an odd breed of slime composed of a hyper-sweet slime compound. Most slime scientists believe this to be the result of their slime cells replicating the natural sugars found in the fruits and floral nectars of the Far, Far Range. Most ranchers agree their plorts taste great on cereal."
pedia:m.risks.honey_slime: "The greatest danger a honey slime poses is found in their plorts. Honey plorts are the sweetest, most delicious plorts known on the Far, Far Range. Other slimes can detect them from much further away than a normal plort and will do everything in their means to get them. A rancher with honey slimes needs to be careful about unintended largos, or worse..."
pedia:m.plortonomics.honey_slime: "Honey plorts are highly prized by food manufacturers. Though the plorts are naturally incredibly sweet, the discovery that they could be further refined into an even sweeter substance made their demand soar. These refined honey plorts are said to score an unprecedented 867 on the Werner-Thompkins-Hong sacchrino scale, just a few points shy of 'not fit for human consumption.'"
pedia:t.hunter_slime: "Hunter Slime"
pedia:m.intro.hunter_slime: "Nevermind the rabbit, have you seen any chickens?"
pedia:m.diet.hunter_slime: "Meat"
pedia:m.favorite.hunter_slime: "Roostro"
pedia:m.slimeology.hunter_slime: "The hunter slime is the wild cousin of the tabby slime. A much more capable creature than the playful tabbies, the hunter slime excels at stalking the chickens of the Far, Far Range.

A hunter slime's slimological makeup allows for a natural cloaking ability that renders it almost completely invisible. Their only tell is in their giant, almond eyes, which can often be seen hovering in the dark. This effect is often described by unsuspecting ranchers as 'aaaahhhhHHH!'"
pedia:m.risks.hunter_slime: "A hunter slime has keen senses and can detect its prey from great distances. This makes finding a good location for their corrals challenging.

Additionally, the wild nature of the hunter is also passed on to any largos formed from its plorts. A newly created hunter largo will always be feral! A prepared rancher knows that breeding hunter largos should always be done slowly, with a few chickens on hand to calm them down."
pedia:m.plortonomics.hunter_slime: "Amazingly, a serum can be made from hunter slime plorts that can actually render a person invisible! The effect only lasts for about a day, but this serum is nonetheless incredibly popular back on Earth as many people find its effects very soothing.

Sometimes you feel like you just want to disappear for a while. But then about a day goes by and you realize that not only did you miss being seen, but others missed seeing you too."
pedia:t.puddle_slime: "Puddle Slime"
pedia:m.intro.puddle_slime: "Keep one in your boot and you'll always stay cool. But it's weird."
pedia:m.diet.puddle_slime: "Water"
pedia:m.favorite.puddle_slime: "(none)"
pedia:m.slimeology.puddle_slime: "Puddle slimes are a rare species of slime that live in fresh water pools found on the range. These slimes don't eat fruits, veggies, or meat like most other slimes. Instead, puddle slimes absorb water into their bodies while they sit on the surface of a pool.

Puddle slimes need fresh water to survive and will quickly evaporate if left on any other surface for too long."
pedia:m.risks.puddle_slime: "Puddle slimes aren't risky to manage, they just require a fair bit of maintenance. A rancher needs a pool of fresh water, like a pond, available for a puddle slime and its plorts to sit in as they will evaporate if away from water.

Finally, puddle slimes are exceptionally shy and will not produce plorts if they are in close proximity to more than 3 other slimes.

Overall, a puddle slime is a better fit for a more experienced rancher, not one still wet behind the ears."
pedia:m.plortonomics.puddle_slime: "Puddle plorts are made almost entirely from an incredible hydro compound known by chemists across the galaxy as H2Ohhhhh. This compound is used to create an absurdly expensive brand of bottled drinking water that is sought after by the elite back on Earth. While some people argue that there is little difference in taste between it and tap water, those people seriously are not getting it."
pedia:t.crystal_slime: "Crystal Slime"
pedia:m.intro.crystal_slime: "It's as clear as shiny, transparent rocks that these slimes are dangerous."
pedia:m.diet.crystal_slime: "Veggies"
pedia:m.favorite.crystal_slime: "Odd Onion"
pedia:m.slimeology.crystal_slime: "Believed to be a cousin of the rock slime, the crystal slime is covered in a crown of shimmering, crystal spikes. These spikes seem to form from the crystal slime generating a tremendous amount of internal heat and warping the minerals around them; a truly alien behavior."
pedia:m.risks.crystal_slime: "The sharp crystals adorned on the crystal slime's crown will cause a great deal of harm if touched. Worse still, the crystal slime routinely creates large patches of hazardous crystals in the environment around them. Thought to be a means of expelling internal heat, these crystal patches are ultra-hot, and can be shattered if splashed with water."
pedia:m.plortonomics.crystal_slime: "Though the crystals produced by a crystal slime are highly unstable, a crystal plort, like all plorts, is far more pure and can be used by slime scientists to engineer a variety of metals that are completely transparent. This innovation has led to metropolitan areas on Earth completely transforming visually, allowing more light to reach the streets and the space as a whole a chance to 'breathe.' Architects often describe these transparent metals as 'so totally cooler than normal, boring metals.'"
pedia:t.quantum_slime: "Quantum Slime"
pedia:m.intro.quantum_slime: "A slime that really shows its potential."
pedia:m.diet.quantum_slime: "Fruit"
pedia:m.favorite.quantum_slime: "Phase Lemon"
pedia:m.slimeology.quantum_slime: "Quantum slimes appear to have resulted from some sort of event that took place in the Ancient Ruins long ago. At all times, the quantum slime is capable of emitting other possible realities of their being. Called 'ghosts,' these other realities can come true, with the quantum slime aligning with the reality of the ghost, effectively teleporting."
pedia:m.risks.quantum_slime: "Quantum slimes can be one of the most difficult slimes to manage, given their unique abilities. A rancher needs to learn to detect when quantum slimes are primed to take over the reality of a ghost and act quickly, such as feeding them or just splashing them with some fresh water as a temporary measure."
pedia:m.plortonomics.quantum_slime: "Quantum plorts are believed by many to hold the secret to infinite resources.  Given the quantum slime's ability to change reality, it's theorized that unlocking the potential of quantum plorts could allow for a technology that converges the realities of other entities into our reality and- well, basically we're talking about cloning stuff. Infinite energy, chickens, whatever. Probably no harmful side effects to this at all."
pedia:t.fire_slime: "Fire Slime"
pedia:m.intro.fire_slime: "Like a little campfire, except that it moves and it's a slime."
pedia:m.diet.fire_slime: "Ash"
pedia:m.favorite.fire_slime: "(none)"
pedia:m.slimeology.fire_slime: "Fire slimes are a rare breed of slime that lives on ash. Fire slimes will eat just about any food, but not without it being burned into ash first. The only way to feed a fire slime is to use an incinerator with an ash trough upgrade.

Fire slimes need ash to survive and will quickly snuff out if left on any other surface for too long. When keeping fire slimes in an ash trough, simply burn any food item to produce some ash and fill the trough."
pedia:m.risks.fire_slime: "A fire slime's naturally burning state makes them bad companions for other slimes as their fiery touch will send a slime flying. Additionally, fire slimes and their plorts need to be kept in an ash trough under an incinerator or they'll quickly snuff out. If you need to deal with fire slimes directly, a splash of fresh water will put out their fires for a short while."
pedia:m.plortonomics.fire_slime: "Fire plorts are used in the developing world on Earth to keep stoves and fireplaces burning. Thanks to fire plorts, warm hands and hot food is a possibility for millions of people who otherwise would not have access to such luxuries.

A rancher won't get rich selling fire plorts, and certainly managing them can be a dangerous endeavour, but they should know that the sale of each helps those in need. Now and far into the future, the little noble actions of every individual help us move forward as a people. That much will never change."
pedia:t.dervish_slime: "Dervish Slime"
pedia:m.intro.dervish_slime: "Twists and turns all day and spirals all night."
pedia:m.diet.dervish_slime: "Fruit"
pedia:m.favorite.dervish_slime: "Prickle Pear"
pedia:m.slimeology.dervish_slime: "A dervish slime is a swirling, whirling bundle of energy in slimy form. Dervish slimes are commonly found in the Glass Desert, cruising across its dusty dunes at high speed atop little whirlwinds.

One thing is for certain: wherever the dervish slime needs to go, it gets there in a hurry."
pedia:m.risks.dervish_slime: "Dervish slimes can cause total chaos on a ranch if not cared for properly. In addition to frequently riding atop whirlwinds at high speed and collecting objects along the way, a highly agitated dervish slime can produce giant cyclones of air that vacuum up and toss about anything they touch.

When cyclones are roaring across your ranch there's little you can do other than brace for the chaos that will soon follow!"
pedia:m.plortonomics.dervish_slime: "Dervish plorts are a fantastic source of clean energy that helps give turbines and generators an extra boost. They are in constant demand as curiously, there is a finite number of spins stored in every dervish plort."
pedia:t.tangle_slime: "Tangle Slime"
pedia:m.intro.tangle_slime: "A slime that- that- AACHOOOO!"
pedia:m.diet.tangle_slime: "Meat"
pedia:m.favorite.tangle_slime: "Painted Hen"
pedia:m.slimeology.tangle_slime: "Though the tangle slime may look innocent with its wide smile and colorful flower atop its head, it's actually a fearsome predator with a big appetite for tasty meat. The tangle slime earned its name from the twisting vines that it can produce to grab things in the environment. 

It's unknown what caused the tangle slime to become such a fearsome predator in the barren wastes of the Glass Desert. However, if the land once resembled the lush greenery of the oases within, perhaps the tangle slime evolved in a much different environment than what you see today."
pedia:m.risks.tangle_slime: "The tangle slime can be a handful on the ranch if they're not well-fed at all times. Not only can tangle slimes tunnel their vines underground to snatch food and plorts from outside of their corrals, but the flowers on their head can produce a noxious pollen cloud that causes other slimes to go into sneezing fits.

When slimes sneeze from the pollen their agitation rapidly increases, causing more boom slime explosions, crystal slime spikes, and all around jumpiness."
pedia:m.plortonomics.tangle_slime: "Despite the troublesome nature of the slimes that create them, tangle plorts have incredibly beneficial agricultural applications. Fertilizers and growth formulas made from tangle plorts are used by farms all across Earth to greatly enhance crop production.

It's speculated that the unusually high nutrient count found within tangle plorts that now grow Earth's vegetables results from the tangle slime's incredible appetite for chickens, but that's super gruesome so let's just ignore that."
pedia:t.mosaic_slime: "Mosaic Slime"
pedia:m.intro.mosaic_slime: "Remarkable from every angle."
pedia:m.diet.mosaic_slime: "Veggies"
pedia:m.favorite.mosaic_slime: "Silver Parsnip"
pedia:m.slimeology.mosaic_slime: "The mosaic slime gets its name from the glittering array of glass tiles that cover its body. This glass produces a similar anomaly found in the desert itself, making the mosaic slime beautiful, but quite dangerous."
pedia:m.risks.mosaic_slime: "Mosaic slimes can be very dangerous for an unprepared rancher. Their glass tiles create a shimmering effect in daylight that attracts other slimes to them. It is unknown why slimes exhibit this behavior exactly, but leading theories indicate that 'sparkly things are super cool.'

Even more dangerous, the mosaic slime can produce glints in the space around them: ultra-hot solar anomalies that grow in intensity before drifting toward the ground and bursting into flames. Glints can be snuffed with a splash of water, but the best way to reduce their appearance is to ensure your mosaic slimes are well-fed and not agitated."
pedia:m.plortonomics.mosaic_slime: "Mosaic plorts are desired for researching the glass structures within the Glass Desert. Samples of this glass turn brittle when taken from the Far, Far Range, yet interestingly, mosaic plorts seem unaffected by this phenomenon.

Almost certainly, this glass is being studied because it's really pretty and not because it can cause devastating solar anomalies."
pedia:t.saber_slime: "Saber Slime"

pedia:m.diet.saber_slime: "Meat"

pedia:m.slimeology.saber_slime: "Though believed to be long extinct, the saber slime lives on through the largo slimes in The Wilds. Saber slimes were believed to be one of the fiercest predators during the Jellassic Period of the Far, Far Range, a time when gigantic slimes roamed the planet.

Though saber slimes are carnivores, the largos in The Wilds display a curious habit of bundling the rare kookadoba fruit into bundles of sticks, mud, and slime that become rock-hard in time. Only Ogden's specially engineered kookacrackers are capable of breaking them."
pedia:m.risks.saber_slime: "Most saber slime largos found in The Wilds are feral, looking to take a bite out of whatever they see. They're also incredibly agile for slimes, capable of powerful jumps that allow them to bound off other surfaces before targeting their prey.

If you encounter a horde of feral saber slime largos, watch your back so you don't get flanked!"

pedia:m.slimeology.tarr_slime: "The tarr are formed when a largo eats a plort unlike the ones it produces. A terrible transformation occurs that turns the slime into a sludge filled with a swirling, prismatic array of colors and a relentless appetite. The tarr seek only to consume and replicate.

The only way to stop a tarr outside of incinerating it or throwing it into the slime sea is with fresh water. One splash will stop a tarr from spawning new tarr, and repeated splashes will destroy it entirely.

Alternatively many ranchers recommend running away with their arms waving, and screaming."
pedia:m.risks.tarr_slime: "The tarr are the single biggest threat to ranchers. The tarr will seek out slimes to consume and replicate themselves, but will also devour chickens, rot crops in their proximity, and even devour ranchers!

If a rancher is to profit from an encounter with a gold slime, they need to think quick."
pedia:m.risks.gold_slime: "Gold slimes produce no direct risks to a rancher but their appearance often induces panic and leads to (sometimes fatal) mistakes. Further, the only way to obtain gold plorts is to strike a gold slime with any spare resources in your vac. Doing so can produce a gold plort, though it also leaves a trail of additional resources in the area, leading to unintended largos, or worse."
pedia:m.plortonomics.gold_slime: "Gold plorts have little practical use and are the most valuable of all plorts simply because they are shiny and rare.

Quicksilver slimes are lightning quick, and feed on electricity. This is generally accomplished by their moving really fast and slowly accumulating the static charge they generate. However, Mochi has decided to speed up the process and created a method for feeding them energy in a far more direct fashion."
pedia:m.risks.quicksilver_slime: "Quicksilver slimes are not normally harmful to a rancher as the static they generate has a low current.

pedia:m.slimeology.lucky_slime: "Lucky slimes are a strange variant of tabby slimes that seem to have a fascination with shiny objects, particularly newbuck coins. A lucky slime gobbles up any coin it can find, giving it a distinct jingling sound as they move about.

However, coins don't make for a balanced diet and a lucky slime will still greedily devour meat of any kind. In so doing, its body bursts with a shower of newbucks, having little room left in its slimy tummy. This burst often sends the lucky slime flying into the air.

Upon detecting a rancher, the lucky slime will soon make a hasty retreat. No known rancher has ever been skillful enough, or perhaps lucky enough, to capture one of these slippery slimes."
pedia:m.risks.lucky_slime: "Lucky slimes pose the same risk to ranchers as other rare slimes: mainly, accidents in their pursuit that can lead to a rancher's demise. The promise of a small fortune when encountering a lucky slime has led more than a few ranchers head-first into the slime sea.

This occurence has led some of the more superstitious ranchers to see the lucky slime as a bad omen, or perhaps as the universe testing their greed. These ranchers will ignore lucky slimes altogether, even purposefully shooing them away. Well, until you hear those newbucks jingling, and then, maybe just one shot couldn't hurt..."
pedia:m.plortonomics.lucky_slime: "A lucky slime isn't known to produce plorts of any kind. Leading slime scientists believe this to be the result of the lucky slime not being a true slime variant. Rather, lucky slimes are believed to be just an abnormal tabby slime: one whose color has faded as a result of ingesting so many coins. It is perhaps this very change that also led to ceasing plort production."

However, this is only a theory as data on twinkle slime behaviors is quite limited.

When they are found, twinkle slimes give away their location with the beautiful songs they sing. On approach, their song will reach a crescendo and all at once, vanish from sight and fill the immediate area with strange motes of energy called chimes.

Twinkle slimes also create a mysterious portal after they vanish that always wisks those who enter it back home. It's not clear what purpose this serves, but some believe that the twinkle slime is reminding those who witness it that time passes whether you notice it or not, and when you do, it's sometimes nice to return home and remind yourself of the person you once were, and the people that made you who you are today."

It was once the site of a mining project but went bust after the discovery that the rare ores it produces quickly break down in atmospheres other than that of the Far, Far Range.

It was later discovered that the means to harness these metals was via rock slime plorts. Somehow, rock slime plorts preserve the minerals within, a process that eludes even the most prestigious slime scientists.

The Indigo Quarry is a natural home for rock slimes and the more elusive rad slime, and its naturally mineral-rich soil make it a great place to harvest most wild veggies."
pedia:t.moss: "Moss Blanket"
pedia:m.intro.moss: "Like a flower blooming from a rocky crack, this emerald expanse hints at what could be."
pedia:m.desc.moss: "The Moss Blanket is an island covered in a thick layer of moss where flora grows wild in great, tangling knots at every turn. The high walls of the cliffs surrounding the island and its great canopy of trees allow for sea mists to pass in and become trapped, creating a unique climate within the otherwise arid range.

The slimes primarily found within the Moss Blanket find its jungle-like conditions perfect: tabby and boom slimes hunt their prey through the thickets with abandon, and honey slimes lounge in the flower beds, eating the great abundance of fruit that can be found at every turn."
pedia:t.ruins: "Ancient Ruins"
pedia:m.intro.ruins: "All that is lost is eventually found, and lost once more."
pedia:m.desc.ruins: "Hidden behind a vast mountain range, the Ancient Ruins stand as one of the few known unnatural structures on the Far, Far Range. Their origin remains a mystery, as do the strange occurences that happen within.

Home to quantum slimes that seem to express many other possible realities of their being, and phase lemon trees that do not remain in one time or place for very long, the Ancient Ruins defy logic and expectation.

Only one thing is certain in the Ancient Ruins: within its deepest chambers lies its greatest secret."
pedia:t.desert: "Glass Desert"
pedia:m.intro.desert: "Under a blistering sun, prismatic giants evoke beauty and peril."
pedia:m.desc.desert: "The Glass Desert is mostly uncharted territory within the Far, Far Range, located so far beyond the ranch it is only accessible via teleportation.

The Glass Desert gets its name from the monolithic glass structures that dot its landscape. Resembling prismatic, frozen flames, these glass structures are believed to have been created during a violent solar event, scorching the land and heating sand and stone into glass. These glass structures are also believed to be the catalyst for the dangerous solar anomalies that regularly occur in the Glass Desert: firestorms that burst from the ground, as if intense heat is desperate to escape the ground below.

But the desert's barren, unforgiving, sometimes violent environment hides a secret: somewhere deep within it lies a memory of what once was, and a means of restoring parts of that memory."
pedia:t.sea: "The Slime Sea"
pedia:m.intro.sea: "An expansive body of water and slime compound that's not fit for swimming, let alone drinking."
pedia:m.desc.sea: "The Slime Sea that covers most of the Far, Far Range is something of a mystery. It is seemingly a mixture of water and slime that is believed to be the primordial pool whence all slimes emerged, though its true purpose is entirely unknown by even the most esteemed slime scientists.

What is known is that the liquid found within the Slime Sea is not fit for drinking, watering crops, or even swimming, as most things seem to quickly sink to the bottom. When a slime enters the slime sea it quickly vanishes but it is widely believed that this far from ends the slime's existence, for slimes that enter the sea can often be seen quickly reappearing back on land, happy as ever. In fact, many slime scientists believe that slimes use the sea as a means of transportation, moving swiftly below the surface and popping out on land wherever they see fit.

But all theories aside, one fact remains very clear, most especially to ranchers: don't enter the Slime Sea!"
pedia:t.wilds: "The Wilds"
pedia:m.intro.wilds: "Filled with the deepest roots of the slime family tree."
pedia:m.desc.wilds: "The Wilds are an ancient, untamed collection of islands that are home to an enormous population of feral slimes. All of these slimes are largo desecendants of saber slimes, one of the oldest known species of slimes.

Ogden Ortiz once explored The Wilds and discovered the rare kookadoba fruit growing within. Since then he has contracted out the dangerous task of collecting these fruits to anyone willing to take on the risk."

Once the property of the legendary slime rancher and notorious old codger, Hobson Twillgers, the ranch has seen better days, as Hobson let it come into a state of disrepair shortly before disappearing completely.

Hobson's whereabouts are currently unknown."

Once placed on a build site, an extractor will begin working, collecting resources from the environment over time. Once it is full of resources, an extractor can be emptied. The best extractors can repeat this cycle multiple times before they finally break down.

Each extractor can find exclusive resources if used in the correct zone:
Pumps can find a special resource in the Dry Reef.
Drills can find a special resource in the Indigo Quarry.
Apiaries can find a special resource in the Moss Blanket.
All extractors can find special resources in the Glass Desert."

pedia:m.intro.drones: "Because everyone can use a helping hand."
pedia:m.desc.drones: "Drones are a highly useful gadget that can reduce some of the work a rancher needs to perform on the ranch to keep things running smoothly.

Once you've built a drone, simply give it a program using three simple inputs:
1. Target: What the drone is looking for on your ranch.
2. Source: Where the drone gets its target.
3. Destination: Where the drone takes its target.

If you give a drone an impossible task, or a drone simply cannot complete their task presently, it will go idle.

A drone can run for about a day before it will return to its station and must be powered up again. Simply give it a refreshing blast of water to recharge it.

A drone only works on your ranch and will only work within the ranch expansion in which you place it.

Sometimes, a drone will overfill an auto-feeder or silo due to a bug in their software. The 7Zee corporation insists this bug is a feature."

Mochi uses a complex system of proprietary electrical generators to call quicksilver slimes out from hiding and then a modified vacpack to feed them charges of electrical energy. The Nimble Valley is also rigged with a series of warptech satellites that instantly transfer quicksilver plorts into a rancher's vac tank, because according to Mochi, having to vac up plorts manually \"is for chumps.\""

Though a wholly digital entity, these slimes could easily be considered 'real' within the limits of the world they inhabit. Glitch slimes do not seek out food like physical slimes; instead, they seem to be expanding to every corner of the Slimeulation, driven by some unknown purpose."
pedia:m.risks.glitch_slime: "Though glitch slimes pose no direct danger to a rancher, their mischievous nature can make for hazardous situations when attempting to wrangle them. Glitch slimes will take the form of other slimes, distinguishable only by the inaccurate face they present. Vac-ing them up or using debug spray will reveal their true form.

Additionally, a glitch slime can take the form of objects commonly found in the Far, Far Range. If you're familiar with the real range, look for objects like rocks and trees that don't seem to belong. A splash of debug spray can reveal many glitch slimes in disguise."
pedia:m.plortonomics.glitch_slime: "A glitch slime does not display any drive to eat the simulated food of the Slimeulation and so no known plorts exist.

However, if glitch slime plorts did exist, they would be virtual like everything in the Slimeulation and have no actual value. Unless of course, a bunch of people decided virtual plorts have value, and then maybe everyone would start buying them. Heck, maybe eventually glitch slime plorts would be worth a fortune because a bunch of us just agree on that too and then we all created our own Slimeulations to generate glitch slime plorts. But if that happened, then we would all be using an absurd amount of real energy, harming our real environment further, all to generate virtual plorts?

So obviously, that's a very silly thing and we'd never do that."

The workshop houses his Slimeulation system that is currently filled with bugs and technical glitches and in need of further testing. Because of this, Viktor has moved on to an unknown, new project somewhere on the Far, Far Range while he seeks a partner to help troubleshoot the Slimeulation.

Though the workshop's undersea nature provides a dramatic effect, it is an extremely practical decision in that the Slime Sea provides a natural cooling system for the tremendous amount of heat the Slimeulation generates. This unnatural warming effect on the Slime Sea is a top priority of Viktor's, and he has stated that if he cannot reduce Slimeulation heat output significantly in the near future, he will shut the entire project down for fear of harming the natural environment."
