All you need to do is check out the Range Exchange machine daily and be sure to get your trade completed within 24 hours.\n\nAs more ranchers get added to your network, you should receive a hearty hello from them so check your inbox.\n\nWell, enough jawin,' we've both got slimes to wrangle.\n\nAdios, Beatrix.\n\n- Thora"

My understanding is that Ms West has already informed you of how the Range Exchange works so I will spare you any further education.\n\nInstead, I'll illuminate you on what you can expect from my own requests. As a slime scientist/rancher I have a tremendous interest in the liquiform legion that we share this vast range with, the slimes. My studies often keep me from venturing out on the range daily and when I find myself short of a particular species, I use the Range Exchange to fill that gap. Don't worry though, I will reimburse you handsomely for your efforts.\n\nGood luck in your new venture, Ms LeBeau. I look forward to seeing life breathed once again into the former Twillgers Ranch.\n\nSincerely,\nViktor Humphries\n\nP.S. - I once lost my most favorite fiddle while fleeing a feral boom slime. Its value is only sentimental but should you find it, I'd very much love to be able to play it again."

Yeah, seriously, they do! I don't see why all ranchers aren't just gobbling them down every chance they get. Being lost out on the range at night can be so dangerous...\n\nWell don't let me ramble on ya here. We'll be in touch via the Range Exchange. I tend to only raise slimes that eat fruits and veggies, so expect those kinds of requests from me.\n\nLookin forward to doing business with ya!\n\nO.O.\n\nP.S. - Ever hear of gilded ginger?

Is the air as clear as they say? I bet it's really beautiful.\n\nI'm probably asking too many questions. I bet you have a lot of work to do on that ranch.

It was raining so hard that the streets were flooding and we took shelter in that cafe. It was like a scene from a movie only we both looked like wet animals. And the guy running the shop was a real tyrant. The only way we could stay inside was by ordering one coffee after another.\n\nI felt like we learned more about each other that day than ever. Maybe it was the coffee because we were both talking really, really fast. I told you about my dreams; making music and all that. At least that's how I remember it.\n\nWalking home, when the rain came back you got closer to me and my heart was racing. But I couldn't blame that on the coffee.\n\n- Casey"

I showed up in normal clothes and shoes and you were decked out and had a pack and gear, it was a nightmare for me, haha.\n\nI think it was around the five mile mark, when I was drenched in sweat and ready to collapse that I realized our ideas of fun were two very different things.

Beatrix LeBeau can climb a mountain before breakfast but can't spend a few days in a *ahem* modestly accommodated, breaks-down-only-half-the-time, VINTAGE touring van. You were so miserable. I still laugh about it.\n\nBut I really did appreciate it for those few days. It was great to have you in the crowd.\n\nThat van still runs by the way.\n\n- Casey\n\nP.S. That was a lie.

And since it was starting to rain I thought it would be really romantic to stumble across the place again. I guess I finally found the courage.\n\nBut the coffee shop went out of business and it was a taco place now. So, we ate tacos in the rain and it was just the best thing.\n\nWe were on the roof of your old apartment hoping to see the fireworks. I was going to tell you something then but that's when you told me about Africa. It sounded like an amazing trip. I was really happy you were doing what you loved to do.\n\n- Casey"

I picture you out there on a safari, avoiding the clutches of lions on the savanna, riding elephants across raging rivers, and then, as you sit under the stars at night, your weathered hand opens up a locket and there's a picture of me inside. And then your loyal chimpanzee companion gives you a somber, knowing look.\n\nIs that accurate? haha\n\nWell, for what it's worth I missed you too when I was in LA. Uuugh, that bar was just awful, but at least I got some stage time.\n\n- Casey\n\nP.S. The chimp's name was Colonel Bananas."

I remember feeling really happy, but something was missing. We both knew that we were giving something up for it all.\n\nI think about it all the time. That if we had been less honest about it all how you might still be running that little garden shop and I'd still be trying to write music out of a basement.\n\nIt doesn't matter. I should have told you then what I never did. I should have said it a hundred times.\n\n- Casey"

London was an opportunity I couldn't pass up, an opportunity to tour and do what I love.\n\nBut I still missed you like crazy. And when you told me about going to the Far, Far Range it made me miss you even more, even before you were gone.\n\nI guess that's just us: what we really want just so happens to be in different parts of the known universe. I mean, there's long distance and then there's being so far away that time itself might actually function differently. Why aren't there more songs about that, huh?\n\n- Casey"

I think it almost scared me when things got easier, and when I finally realized that what we each have now is what we wanted all along. Because if you're still the girl that I know, you're happy out there on the very farthest frontier.\n\nAnd I hope the happiness you feel now lasts forever. I hope that the sunsets over there are as gorgeous as they are over here and that if you search far enough on a rainy day some rancher out there has a taco stand you can visit. I realize that last one probably isn't likely to happen but it sure would be romantic, right?\n\nI'm glad to have shared a part of me with you, Beatrix LeBeau.

Lots of excitement, lots of butterflies.\n\nAnd even though I know you're so far away, I keep thinking that maybe I'll catch you somewhere out there in the crowd.\n\nIf that ever happens, I promise I'll sing a song for you.

I figured it would be fun to tinker with on rainy days.\n\nI only nearly blew myself up three times, which is pretty good given my tendency for that sort of thing in my other hobbies. But it soon became a reminder that I have a thirst for adventure, and being cooped up in a barn all day wasn't ever going to satisfy that thirst.\n\nSoon, I began to set my sights for horizons beyond this ranch.

Drifting off, I'd pretend I was drifting in a sea of stars, across the limitless black of space.\n\nIt's funny how when you dream, you sure become a sucker for the impossible.

And then I realized that if I didn't do something, I'd end up like that tree: I'd spend my whole life in the same place.\n\nI wasn't going to let that happen.

mail:m.journal.jo_desert_glass: "Must have been one heck of a scorcher that caused these glass formations. They always looked like flames to me, like a great firestorm covered this land before being frozen in time.\n\nThen again, maybe these are flames burning away but at a pace we can't even perceive. Perhaps this desert has two different times overlapping one another and here we are stuck in the middle of it.\n\nWouldn't that just be wild?\n\n- H"
mail:m.journal.jo_desert_overlook: "Quite a sight to gaze upon the sand sea out there, no? I've scoured every corner of the desert and everywhere I look, that sand sea stretches to the horizon. Makes you wonder just where the heck on the Far, Far Range you are when the Slime Sea is nowhere to be found!\n\n- H"
mail:m.journal.jo_desert_end01: "Two doors, Beatrix. Life is filled with moments where there's two doors and you can only choose one.\n\nI came to the Far, Far Range because a search for the unknown is in my bones. And in time, even a thousand light years away from Earth wasn't enough. So I searched for secrets within the Ancient Ruins that led me here.\n\nThis place was my ticket to go even further.\n\n- H"
mail:m.journal.jo_desert_end02: "The ruins are actually great engines that allow for travel through space and maybe even time! After years of study, I knew how to activate them and I alone would be the first to cross over into the true beyond. It was the ultimate adventure.\n\nBut then there's that other door: I met Thora and fell in love. What are the chances of that?\n\nShe had a piece of my heart, and the universe had the other.\n\nTwo doors, Beatrix.\n\n- H"
mail:m.journal.jo_desert_end03: "I chose my door.\n\nI went back to the ranch and promptly sold it. I packed my things, and took a tour of this beautiful land one last time, leaving these little notes for you. It was time I said goodbye to the life I had.\n\nMy hands and feet tingled as I approached this monolithic warp terminal. What lay ahead of me was an adventure unlike anything I had ever known in my life.\n\nI stepped on to the platform, my heart racing...\n\n- H"
mail:m.journal.jo_desert_end04: "...but I didn't go.\n\nI had packed for a new adventure, but it wasn't going to be beyond space and time. So I said a little goodbye to what could have been and headed to Thora's ranch. I'm looking forward to hearing the sound of those wind chimes.\n\nI've never been in love before. Never known anything like it. It's time I got to knowing what all the fuss is about.\n\nSo good luck to ya, Beatrix. Always remember to use your head, but let your heart do the thinkin' every now and again. It might surprise ya.\n\n- H"
