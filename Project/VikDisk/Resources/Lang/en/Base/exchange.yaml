exchange:m.offer_4.viktor: "If you listen very closely, you can hear a boom slime's cells vibrate. But don't listen for long."

exchange:m.offer.ogden_rewards_level1.intro.1: "Hiya, Beatrix! Thanks for coming down to my Retreat and hearing me out on my offer. So, let's get right down to business!"
exchange:m.offer.ogden_rewards_level1.intro.2: "I built this place years ago as a little vacation spot for myself. Later on I realized that it neighbors a cluster of islands filled with primitive saber slimes!"
exchange:m.offer.ogden_rewards_level1.intro.3: "I called these islands The Wilds, and after exploring them they revealed their true secret: the rare kookadoba fruit!"
exchange:m.offer.ogden_rewards_level1.intro.4: "What's a kookadoba? Why it's only the most delectable, irresistable fruit in the known universe! Well, MOST people say it tastes like rotten cheese but they're wrong!"
exchange:m.offer.ogden_rewards_level1.intro.5: "Anyway, I soon became obsessed with kookadobas, but I found myself quickly becoming too old and too slow to deal with the risk."
exchange:m.offer.ogden_rewards_level1.intro.6: "You see, The Wilds are home to hordes of feral slimes, the descendants of the ancient saber slimes that once hunted these lands. Collecting kookadobas is dangerous."
exchange:m.offer.ogden_rewards_level1.intro.7: "And that's where you come in! I'll happily reward you for collecting those sweet, sweet  kookadobas for me. Just deposit them into this custom range exchange here and we're in business!"
exchange:m.offer.ogden_rewards_level1.intro.8: "Collect enough of them for me and I'll start by giving you my secret miracle mix for your gardens! I'll also reward you with a block of my special spicy tofu for every 3 kookadobas."
exchange:m.offer.ogden_rewards_level1.intro.9: "I've activated the teleporter to The Wilds here at the Retreat and it's now yours to explore as you see fit. Just know that the warp network there is a little buggy..."
exchange:m.offer.ogden_rewards_level1.intro.10: "You won't always arrive at the same place and you'll have to find a working teleporter to make your way back. It's buggy, I know. Just be prepared!"
exchange:m.offer.ogden_rewards_level1.repeat.1: "Head in to The Wilds and get those kookadoba fruits! Just be careful: there're lots of feral saber slimes roaming every inch of those islands."
exchange:m.offer.ogden_rewards_level1.repeat.2: "Oh, and one more thing! Saber slimes have an odd habit of bundling up kookadoba into mudballs that harden up like stone. The only way to break them open is with something I designed called a kookacracker!"
exchange:m.offer.ogden_rewards_level1.repeat.3: "You'll find them scattered across The Wilds; can't miss them! Just shoot a mudball into them and collect those sweet... delicious- my mouth is watering just thinking about them! Go, go, go!"
exchange:m.offer.ogden_rewards_level2.intro.1: "Thanks so much for all those kookadobas! You're off to a great start. The miracle mix I developed for my own crops is now available in your garden upgrades."
exchange:m.offer.ogden_rewards_level2.intro.2: "Miracle mix prevents fruits and veggies from rotting. And don't worry, I make it with all-natural materials; good, healthy stuff."
exchange:m.offer.ogden_rewards_level2.intro.3: "But I didn't always think this way. I used to run a huge company on Earth that made insta-food: quick, cheap meals made of nothing but chemicals and preservatives."
exchange:m.offer.ogden_rewards_level2.intro.4: "We made billions, but we weren't making real food. Instead, our  'food engineers' worked to 'design products.' It wasn't right..."
exchange:m.offer.ogden_rewards_level2.intro.5: "So I came to the Far, Far Range to grow my own wholesome food with my two hands. I wanted to leave my life on Earth behind."
exchange:m.offer.ogden_rewards_level2.intro.6: "But enough about that, on to more kookadobas! If you get me a bunch more I'll give you the specs for a deluxe upgrade for your gardens!"
exchange:m.offer.ogden_rewards_level2.intro.7: "Get to it, Beatrix! I've got a new recipe here and I need loads of kookadoba to get it juuuust right!"
exchange:m.offer.ogden_rewards_level2.repeat.1: "Head back into The Wilds and collect those kookadobas! I'll reward you with a deluxe upgrade for your gardens if you get me enough!"
exchange:m.offer.ogden_rewards_level3.intro.1: "You did it! I can try out my new recipe with all these delicious kookadobas!"
exchange:m.offer.ogden_rewards_level3.intro.2: "I really love to cook, it calms me down and lets me focus on making something nutritious for body and soul."
exchange:m.offer.ogden_rewards_level3.intro.3: "It's funny, food only became a true passion for me after leaving my insta-food company."
exchange:m.offer.ogden_rewards_level3.intro.4: "To be honest, I didn't leave. I was ousted by the board of directors because I tried to sabotage the company. I wanted to see it fall."
exchange:m.offer.ogden_rewards_level3.intro.5: "We were making people sick, Beatrix. The 'food' we sold was garbage and we knew it. It was all about the money. I wanted it all to go away."
exchange:m.offer.ogden_rewards_level3.intro.6: "But it had become too big. I couldn't stand up against it so I was gone. I got my ticket to the Far, Far Range soon thereafter."
exchange:m.offer.ogden_rewards_level3.intro.7: "And so here we are! Listening to me carry on about the past instead of focusing on those kookadobas! Let's get back on track."
exchange:m.offer.ogden_rewards_level3.intro.8: "Get me another load of kookadobas and I'll be so grateful that I'll give you the keys to my Retreat! That's right, it'll all be yours to keep."
exchange:m.offer.ogden_rewards_level3.intro.9: "Good luck out there!"
exchange:m.offer.ogden_rewards_level3.repeat.1: "Get me this last load of kookadobas and this retreat is yours to keep! Good luck!"
exchange:m.offer.ogden_recur.intro.1: "Oh my! Oh dear! That's so many kookadobas!"
exchange:m.offer.ogden_recur.intro.2: "I can taste it now: hearty kookadoba and parsnip pie, sweet kookadoba jam for years... oh! Kookadoba omelettes with painted hen eggs!"
exchange:m.offer.ogden_recur.intro.3: "You've given me such a gift here, Beatrix. I'm so grateful. Ogden's Retreat is now yours to use as you see fit."
exchange:m.offer.ogden_recur.intro.4: "But you know... if you wanted to keep exploring The Wilds and giving me kookadobas I'd be happy to pay you in tofu."
exchange:m.offer.ogden_recur.intro.5: "So thanks again Beatrix! It was great working with you and getting a chance to talk to someone."
exchange:m.offer.ogden_recur.intro.6: "Life on the range is wonderful, but it can get a little lonely out here when it's just you and the memories you can't let go..."
exchange:m.offer.ogden_recur.intro.7: "So it's good to have someone who's there for you, even if they just listen every now and again."
exchange:m.offer.ogden_recur.intro.8: "Thanks for listening Beatrix. Now let's get back to work!"
exchange:m.offer.ogden_recur.repeat.1: "The Retreat is yours but I'll be happy to give you a block of my special spicy tofu for every 3 kookadobas you harvest from The Wilds. Be careful!"
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level1.intro.1: "So, you finally decided to show up... Since we're already running short on time, I'll get right to it."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level1.intro.2: "You're standing in one of my many estates at the edge of the Nimble Valley, which is the only known home to the very rare quicksilver slimes."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level1.intro.3: "And everything you see here is MY property, which means that I alone profit from all the quicksilver plorts that the Nimble Valley produces. Brilliant, I know."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level1.intro.4: "Harvesting quicksilver plorts is very difficult and only highly-skilled, pro ranchers like myself can manage it."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level1.intro.5: "But I'm EXTREMELY busy, since I've got a ranch to manage and a ton of the Miles Tech business back on Earth to run."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level1.intro.6: "So I need you to get in there and do it for me. Naturally, you'll be compensated. We want you to be a happy little worker bee after all."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level1.intro.7: "Now pay attention because I don't like to repeat myself: first, you'll notice that I've augmented that junker of a vacpack you have with some cutting edge Miles Tech. This never leaves the valley, so don't get excited."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level1.intro.8: "This augment will activate using patented Miles Tech any time you try to enter the Nimble Valley. It'll swap out your vac tanks too, but don't worry, you won't lose the junk you had in there."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level1.intro.9: "Next, take the teleporter to the Nimble Valley and get to work collecting quicksilver plorts. I'll explain things once you get there but let me give you a quick rundown..."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level1.intro.10: "The quicksilver slimes in the Nimble Valley lie dormant until you activate the generator to send out a pulse and get them moving. But this generator only works for so long and then needs to recharge."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level1.intro.11: "Quicksilver slimes eat electricity, and since they're super fast the only way to get it to them is to blast them with a tasty, spark shot from your vacpack."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level1.intro.12: "But don't worry about actually collecting the plorts. I've got the valley rigged with Miles Tech that will collect them for you."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level1.intro.13: "After the generator shuts down, head back and deposit the quicksilver plorts here and I'll be sure you get paid."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level1.intro.14: "Money talks, so for every 10 quicksilver plorts you deposit, I'll give you a cut of the profits. Collect enough of them for me, and I'll give you an even bigger reward."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level1.intro.15: "We'll start with what I call \"Mochi's Extra Mile,\" which is me sometimes giving you the inside scoop on a more lucrative plort price. Just don't count on it all the time. We're not friends."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level1.intro.16: "Now get out there and collect some quicksilver plorts for me. And if you're feeling like you really know how to shake it, try the other teleporter to an even trickier part of the valley."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level1.intro.17: "...or don't, because you know it would be hopeless. Later, tater."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level1.repeat.1: "Do I really need to repeat myself? Take the teleporter to the Nimble Valley and start blasting some quicksilver slimes with electric charges."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level1.repeat.2: "Once the generator shuts down, go do whatever it is you do until it's recharged. Then come back and get cracking."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level1.repeat.3: "I mean, I don't NEED you to do this. I could easily do it myself but..."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level1.repeat.4: "Just go do it. You want to get paid, don't you?"
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level2.intro.1: "Well heck, I didn't think you'd actually manage to collect enough plorts to get the first reward. But a deal is a deal."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level2.intro.2: "You're now one of the only people in the entire universe to be getting the inside track on plort sales. I call it \"Mochi's Extra Mile.\""
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level2.intro.3: "My extra mile will give you DOUBLE newbucks for plort deposits at the market. But don't get too excited. It won't happen all the time. I'm not that generous."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level2.intro.4: "See, that's the thing, Beatrix: you have got to learn to fend for yourself out here. Once you're on the Far, Far Range, no one back home can help you out, even if they wanted to..."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level2.intro.5: "...at least that's what I think. That's got to be the reason no one ever answers. I mean, it's just so far away, right?"
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level2.intro.6: "Well, who asked you anyway? Don't you understand how busy my dad is running one of the biggest tech companies in the entire galaxy? What do you know, anyway!?"
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level2.intro.7: "Enough of that. Let's get back to why you're here: to work. Here's the deal: keep collecting those quicksilver plorts and I'll keep paying you."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level2.intro.8: "And if you collect enough, the next reward I'll give you will be my secret tech for maximizing chicken production: the Deluxe Coop."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level2.intro.9: "So get to work."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level2.repeat.1: "Why are we sitting here talking when you could be collecting quicksilver plorts? Do it and I'll reward you with a Deluxe Coop upgrade for that dump you call a ranch."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level2.repeat.2: "Get to work."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level3.intro.1: "What the- You collected how many? Well then, I suppose the Deluxe Coop is now available to you."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level3.intro.2: "I would say good luck managing all those chickens, but honestly, you... seem to know how to handle yourself."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level3.intro.3: "You know, sometimes I feel like this whole planet is a coop. Just a pen to keep people far away."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level3.intro.4: "Sometimes I feel like my dad didn't send me out here for a \"special assignment\" at all."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level3.intro.5: "Sometimes... sometimes I feel like I was sent here to stay out of his way."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level3.intro.6: "Just a chicken in a coop..."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level3.intro.7: "..."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level3.intro.8: "S-speaking of chickens... what's a birdbrain like you doing hanging around when there's so much work to do?!"
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level3.intro.9: "Let's get back to the task at hand: get me another batch of quicksilver plorts and I'll give you a very special reward: access to this manor and its plots."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level3.intro.10: "My manor would be the one ranch expansion you have that isn't embarrassing. Wouldn't that be nice?"
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level3.repeat.1: "Come on now, wouldn't you like a little extra spending money and access to the rest of my manor here?"
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level3.repeat.2: "I don't care either way. I've got other manors that are way better than this one anyway."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_rewards_level3.repeat.3: "...but all the same: get to work."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_recur.intro.1: "Well, well, it looks like you're now the proud owner of Mochi's Manor. Your cachet is rising as we speak."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_recur.intro.2: "Maybe if you're lucky I may even come visit some time... just to see what you do with the place, not for any other reason. This is just business."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_recur.intro.3: "..."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_recur.intro.4: "You know, I don't normally work with anyone else. I don't want the help. I don't need it."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_recur.intro.5: "But this wasn't so bad, you know. It was nice to talk to someone else who is almost as talented as I am."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_recur.intro.6: "And it got me thinking... maybe you and I are just two chickens out here in a coop, and maybe we're not. Maybe..."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_recur.intro.7: "...maybe I'm gonna build an empire out here that'll be better than anything my dad could ever dream up."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_recur.intro.8: "And maybe... maybe I'll be doing this for me, and no one else. Because I'm starting to think that the only person you need to live up to is yourself."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_recur.intro.9: "Heck, maybe we'll even partner up some day, Beatrix..."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_recur.intro.10: "...but not today."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_recur.intro.11: "Now get out of here. You've got a new ranch expansion to manage and I'm still paying for quicksilver plorts if you still have the chops to collect them."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_recur.intro.12: "Later, tater."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_recur.repeat.1: "You think just because we've had a little chat now and again that this is some kind of friendship?"
exchange:m.offer.mochi_recur.repeat.2: "Get to-"
exchange:m.offer.mochi_recur.repeat.3: "..."
exchange:m.offer.mochi_recur.repeat.4: "When you're ready, head to the valley and collect those quicksilver plorts. It... would be a big help."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.intro.1: "HELLO BEATRIX. THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO ASSIST ME WITH THIS PROJECT."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.intro.2: "IT IS A MATTER OF GREAT IMPORTANCE THAT-"
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.intro.3: "IS SOMETHING...?"
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.intro.4: "..."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.intro.5: "!!!"
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.intro.6: "My apologies. I am in the middle of some, er, delicate work and I sometimes forget I'm wearing my immersion field."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.intro.7: "Now then, the matter at hand: I need some assistance testing an in-development, simulated reality of the Far, Far Range. I am attempting to use this simulation to predict slime behaviors and evolution."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.intro.8: "Alternatively, you could call it... a SLIMEULATION."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.intro.9: "..."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.intro.10: "Hm... I had calculated a response of at least a mild chuckle from that wordplay."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.intro.11: "But no matter! Let's proceed: my Slimeulation is an infinitely complex project that could be the key to understanding slimes on a level we've never dreamed!"
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.intro.12: "HOWEVER!"
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.intro.13: "...it is sadly riddled with bugs."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.intro.14: "Well, not bugs per se. Technically speaking they are a flawed simulation of a slime that has discovered a way to replicate. Fascinating in its own right, but very much disrupting my studies."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.intro.15: "I call these entities glitch slimes. And I need you to help me collect them for study."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.intro.16: "Here's how it works: enter the Slimeulation and begin exploring. Your goal is to collect glitch slimes which will automatically be turned into bug reports upon exiting the Slimeulation."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.intro.17: "However, this is easier said than done. Glitch slimes have exhibited a curious behavior of conforming to their surroundings, perhaps... to avoid detection from me? It is not clear."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.intro.18: "Refocusing the discourse: glitch slimes will look like normal slime largos and objects within the environment, though something is usually off about them."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.intro.19: "To reveal them, vac up the largos you suspect, and use my handy Debug Spray on suspicious objects in the environment."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.intro.20: "As a reward for your efforts I'll grant you manifold cubes, a special, multi-purpose resource I invented, which you can use for fabricating unique gadgets from the blueprints you'll find in the Slimeulation."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.intro.21: "And as we conclude each major phase of our work, I'll also grant you additional rewards, but more on those later."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.intro.22: "My research has determined that adding mystery to reward mechanisms incentivises participants to try harder."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.intro.23: "Oh, and this is really not terribly important and I'm certain it's quite nearly under control but..."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.intro.24: "...due to a data corruption in the Slimeulation there will reach a point where tarr-like entities will begin appearing and taking over the Slimeulation and you should really get out right away."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.intro.25: "When this occurs I'll be sure to signal a beacon on the first available location where you can safely log out. Just follow the exit markers when you see them. They'll lead you to the exit portal."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.intro.26: "Okay? Great! Glad you have no questions at all. Especially about that last bit. So let's get to work!"
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.repeat.1: "Hello again. I hypothesize that you're seeking another summary of how to engage with the Slimeulation? Given the complexity of the task it is most understandable."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.repeat.2: "Step 1: Enter the Slimeulation and begin looking for glitch slimes. They will be disguised as largo slimes or objects that will seem out of place."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.repeat.3: "Step 2: Vac up suspicious slimes and use Debug Spray on suspicious objects to reveal glitch slimes."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.repeat.4: "Step 3: Vac up glitch slimes, avoid taking damage, and most of all avoid the tarr-like corruption that I PROMISE to fix as soon as possible."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.repeat.5: "Step 4: When the exit portal opens, follow the exit markers to the portal and safely log out of the Slimeulation."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.repeat.6: "Step 5: The glitch slimes in your vac tank will have automatically converted to bug reports. Turn them in and be rewarded with invaluable scientific data! And other rewards too... but the data!"
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.repeat.7: "Please note that in the interest of efficiency I have recorded this exchange and should you call again during this phase of the project, I will simply replay this recording."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.repeat.8: "Hm, but that last part is not material to the instructions and should probably be edited out..."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.repeat.9: "As should the last statement I just made about editing the previous statement and-"
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.repeat.10: "..."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level1.repeat.11: "Thank you, Beatrix. Goodbye."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.intro.1: "HELLO AGAIN, BEATRIX. I AM CURRENTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF IMPORTANT WORK AND REQUIRE FOCUS TIME FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL MINUTES."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.intro.2: "THEREFORE I HAVE CONTRACTED OUT THE PHASE 1 REWARD DISTRIBUTION TO A  SCIENTIFIC COLLEAGUE OF MINE."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.intro.3: "CONNECTING YOU NOW."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.intro.4: "..."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.intro.5: "...\n......"
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.intro.6: "HALLLooo"
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.intro.7: "..."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.intro.8: "chikken?"
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.intro.9: "..."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.intro.10: "cHckkN = ?"
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.intro.11: "chikKn = Chkken + chIKkN!"
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.intro.12: "..."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.intro.13: "..."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.intro.14: "..."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.intro.15: "Now then, I trust that my colleague compensated you well?"
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.intro.16: "Hm? No, I've never actually met him in-person, but that's not unusual for me."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.intro.17: "You see, I generally run simulations for everything I can in my life, including relationships with others."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.intro.18: "You might think this is perhaps... too clinical of an approach? But I can assure you, it saves a significant amount of time."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.intro.19: "And time is so valuable! And so very finite... It is the singular cruelty of nature. So why waste a second of it building a friendship that ends? Or a romantic interest that leaves you cold? Wasteful."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.intro.20: "So I simulate it all and determine where it is likely to lead. It is all very precise, and allows me to operate on a timeline that is most optimal."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.intro.21: "But clearly there are still kinks to work out as the simulation I ran of you assisting me had you completing phase 1 much later than the actual result. How odd..."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.intro.22: "I'll add fixing this issue to my agenda. In the meantime, let's begin phase 2 of the project."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.intro.23: "The bug reports you've submitted so far are fascinating. Within the limits of the Slimeulation, glitch slimes appear to be very much 'real.'"
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.intro.24: "I need to know more. Gather more bug reports and I'll grant you access to blueprints for my custom advanced drones! They're doubly effective at ranch work. Efficiency!"
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.intro.25: "..."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.intro.26: "...\n......"
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.intro.27: "Sorry, I often forget about goodbyes. Um, goodbye... for now."

exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.repeat.3: "..."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.repeat.4: "That's odd. Someone hijacked my connection. I'll have to look into that later."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.repeat.5: "Now then, do you need something? I've updated my simulation projections for this phase and I'm confident they will be accurate."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.repeat.6: "They have even accounted for this exchange. Including if I- I- AAAAAACHOOOO!"
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.repeat.7: "PERFECT!"
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.repeat.8: "My projections included that sneeze based on rising dust levels in my lab."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.repeat.9: "Looking forward to your results. They should prove to be-"

exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.repeat.11: "..."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level2.repeat.13: "..."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level3.intro.1: "..."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level3.intro.2: "Hm... something is not right. Not right at all."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level3.intro.3: "The simulation I've been running to predict your performance on this project is not matching your results at all. How is this possible?"
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level3.intro.4: "I rely on my simulations for everything and they have always made life easier, but what if they're wrong? Or what if...?"
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level3.intro.5: "What if some other element exists that even I can't simulate?"
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level3.intro.6: "I would need to create an entirely new formula to compensate for this finding!"
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level3.intro.7: "And what would that mean for my previous simulations? All the experiences and people I've passed on because..."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level3.intro.8: "I need to think on this."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level3.intro.9: "I've added my advanced drone blueprint to your Lab. It should prove very useful to you according to my calculations."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level3.intro.10: "Well, I hope so at least. Now I-"
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level3.intro.11: "I need to think on this right away."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level3.intro.12: "..."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level3.intro.13: "BUT PLEASE COLLECT MORE BUG REPORTS IN THE SLIMEULATION."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level3.intro.14: "I AM VERY CLOSE TO ISOLATING THE SOURCE OF THE BUG THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PRODUCING GLITCH SLIMES."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level3.intro.15: "IN RETURN I WILL PREPARE A SUBSTANTIAL REWARD FOR YOU."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level3.intro.16: "RUN DIAGNOSTICS ON SIMULATION 392296."

exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level3.intro.20: "..."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level3.intro.21: "I'm sorry. I slipped into my work again without saying goodbye."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level3.intro.22: "Looking forward to your results. Goodbye."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level3.repeat.1: "HELLO AGAIN. DO NOT WORRY, I CAN EASILY MANAGE INTERFACING WITH YOU AND WORKING."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level3.repeat.2: "ISOLATE SLIME SPAWN NODE 58.42.19B. DISPLAY SPAWN TYPE ARRAY. CROSS REFERENCE WITH SPAWN NODE 58.43.19A."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level3.repeat.3: "AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY, PLEASE COLLECT MORE BUG REPORTS. I AM VERY CLOSE TO DISCOVERING THE SOURCE OF THE BUG IN MY SLIMEULATION."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level3.repeat.4: "CREATE PROXY MESH OF LOWER DRY REEF, ZONE ID 44-G. REPLACE SLIME SPAWN NODES WITH THOSE FOUND IN PROTOTYPE DATABASE."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level3.repeat.5: "SO PLEASE RETURN TO THE SLIMEULATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I'VE ALREADY BEGUN FABRICATING MORE MANIFOLD CUBES IN ANTICIPATION OF YOUR WORK."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level3.repeat.6: "RUN SIMULATION."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level3.repeat.7: "GOODBYE, BEATRIX."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_rewards_level3.repeat.8: "END TRANSMISSION."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_recur.intro.1: "Hello Beatrix. Good to see you again. The bug reports you have been collecting have been most illuminating."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_recur.intro.2: "With your help, I've isolated the source of the glitch slimes and have a fix in place for removing them in order to continue my work on the Slimeulation."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_recur.intro.3: "But first, I must tell you something."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_recur.intro.4: "I've determined that the simulation I've been running on your performance with this project isn't wrong at all."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_recur.intro.5: "Though true it projected seemingly incorrect results, it was missing a crucial datapoint..."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_recur.intro.6: "...that the universe can surprise you."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_recur.intro.7: "Until I observed your willingness to help me, a stranger really, and then your tenacity within the Slimeulation, I thought people and their abilities were much more predictable."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_recur.intro.8: "But you've shown me that all the data in the world still won't account for the spark in all humans that motivates them."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_recur.intro.9: "And this doesn't mean attempting to project and learn with scientific process isn't worth pursuing! Quite the opposite, in fact."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_recur.intro.10: "But it is important that we- that I, remember that the unexpected still has value."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_recur.intro.11: "I... I regret that I have not seen this until now."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_recur.intro.12: "Had I not simulated relationships and simply let them surprise me, then perhaps I would have connected with a lot more people in my life."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_recur.intro.13: "So with that in mind, I do hope you will continue to stay in touch. And to encourage this, I am giving you ownership of my workshop."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_recur.intro.14: "Additionally, I have decided not to fix the bug that created glitch slimes."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_recur.intro.15: "It would seem to me that this very unexpected result is worth keeping, worth studying."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_recur.intro.16: "So let's just see where it goes. Who knows, though my Slimeulation may not be a perfect recreation of the Far, Far Range, it has its own merits because it's so different."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_recur.intro.17: "In that sense, it is a very exciting discovery!"
exchange:m.offer.viktor_recur.intro.18: "So please continue to collect bug reports so that I may continue to study glitch slimes. And I will continue to give you manifold cubes for your efforts."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_recur.intro.19: "But also, perhaps we could occasionally just chat. You can pick the topic."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_recur.intro.20: "I think I would very much enjoy that."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_recur.repeat.1: "Hello Beatrix! It's good to see you again."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_recur.repeat.2: "I have been continuing to monitor the behavior of glitch slimes. It seems that even without updating my Slimeulation code, they continue to evolve!"
exchange:m.offer.viktor_recur.repeat.3: "It will be exciting to see where their life takes them next."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_recur.repeat.4: "On a similar note, I wanted you to know that I have begun a starmail exchange with an old acquaintance of mine."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_recur.repeat.5: "We have little in common, disagree on several scientific topics, they are very slow to reply and I find that especially irritating, but we both adore the same music."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_recur.repeat.6: "It is wonderful."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_recur.repeat.7: "Please feel free to continue your work within the Slimeulation. And I do hope you're finding my workshop most useful."
exchange:m.offer.viktor_recur.repeat.8: "I look forward to seeing what you do with it, whatever that may be."
