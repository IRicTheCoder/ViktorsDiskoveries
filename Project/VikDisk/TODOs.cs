// TODO: Turn VikDisk QOL a separated dll/mod.
// This way if someone wants the QOL features but not the mod (mostly cause of the lore) they can still have them.

// TODO: Force both compatibility and incompability with certain mods
// This is just if one couldn't override the mods themselves.

// TODO: Fix some of the icons not being 512x512

// TODO: Create a CookingDefinition based on GadgetDefinition
// Something similar to the gadget definition could help when creating new meals

// TODO: Re-use the Largo Icons to create the Chunko Icons

// TODO: Make registries and enum patches for all enums and extras added by my mod
// Vik Disk should be as extendable and compatible as possible, if people want to make addons or add things to
// theirs mods that will interface with mine that should be always allowed.
