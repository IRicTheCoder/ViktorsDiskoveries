* [ ] Fossil – Slimes that can only be found as fossils (or in the case of the saber as descendants). It will be possible to use their DNA, from the fossils, to bring them back.
* [ ] Godly – Slimes that have great power and can use some energy similar to magic. They are seen as gods by the other slimes as they keep the slime world alive with their energy.
* [ ] Special – Slimes like the Tarr or Twinkle slime are seen as special cause they aren’t normal and don’t fit into any other category.

### Behavior
* [ ] Passive – Does not damage the rancher in any way. The aggitation will not cause difference in behaviours.
* [ ] Neutral – Might damage the rancher indirectly. The aggitation might cause aggressive behaviour similar to the rolling of the rock slime.
* [ ] Aggressive – Attacks the rancher directly.
